### What This Is:
A Step-Based Local Artificial Intelligence Orchestrator

#### How It Works:
- **Engine**: The core component responsible for managing and orchestrating the AI workflow.
- **Steps**: Segmented logical units that define specific tasks or actions within the orchestration process. Steps can be chained together to form a comprehensive workflow.
- **Tasks**: Specific, actionable components of each step. These are executed sequentially by the engine.

#### How to Run the Example:
To run an example using this orchestrator, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m run_task
```

#### Notes:
- This setup requires LM Studio to be running at `http://localhost:1234/v1`.
